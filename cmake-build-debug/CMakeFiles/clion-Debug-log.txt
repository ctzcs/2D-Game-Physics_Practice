sdl2-gfx provides CMake targets:

  # this is heuristically generated, and may not be correct
  find_package(sdl2-gfx CONFIG REQUIRED)
  target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE SDL2::SDL2_gfx)

The package zlib is compatible with built-in CMake targets:

    find_package(ZLIB REQUIRED)
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE ZLIB::ZLIB)

sdl2-image provides CMake targets:

    find_package(SDL2_image CONFIG REQUIRED)
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE $<IF:$<TARGET_EXISTS:SDL2_image::SDL2_image>,SDL2_image::SDL2_image,SDL2_image::SDL2_image-static>)
